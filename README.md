**Problem Statement :** 





The Technical Education Department faces challenges in effectively engaging with its diverse community, which includes students, faculty, and stakeholders. Traditional communication methods often lead to delays in response time, inadequate support, and difficulties in accessing relevant information, hindering the overall educational experience. To address these issues, there is a pressing need to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can provide real-time assistance, streamline information dissemination, and offer personalized support, ultimately enhancing the quality of technical education services.

**Purpose :**

The main goal of the project is to create an AI-powered chatbot specifically designed for the Technical Education Department, with an emphasis on improving efficiency, datadriven decision-making, and user assistance. This chatbot will be available around-the clock and respond to a wide range of user inquiries in a fast and accurate manner. Routine chores can be automated to save staff effort and perhaps save money. Additionally, it gathers insightful data that helps the agency make defensible judgments. The integration of active feedback and user-centric design enhances user pleasure, while the chatbot’s scalability establishes it as a role model for comparable establishments. To put it briefly, the project’s goal is to provide a scalable, user-friendly chatbot that will enhance the department’s instructional program and overall operational effectiveness.

**Conclusion :**

In this project, we developed a college-specific chatbot system that can be tailored to the education domain. By adding this chatbot system to the college website,
it will increase user interaction because it is domain-specific and responds to user inquiries accurately.
